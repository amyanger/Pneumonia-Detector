# 🏥 Pneumonia Detector using Deep Learning

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **deep learning-based Pneumonia detection system** that analyzes **lung scans (X-ray images)** to classify whether a patient has **Pneumonia or not**. It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for high-accuracy image classification.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/arjun-myanger/Pneumonia-Detector.git
cd Pneumonia-Detector
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Download Dataset
This model is trained on **Chest X-ray images**. You can download the dataset from:
- **Kaggle:** [Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- **NIH Dataset:** [NIH Chest X-rays](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC)

Place the dataset inside the `data/` folder.

### 4️⃣ Train the Model
```sh
python src/train.py
```
This will train a **CNN model** using the provided dataset.

### 5️⃣ Make Predictions
To classify a new lung scan, run:
```sh
python src/predict.py --image path/to/xray.jpg
```

- Uses **TensorFlow/Keras** for training.
- High-accuracy classification of **Pneumonia vs. Normal**.

### ✅ 2️⃣ Image Preprocessing
- Applies **grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization** to improve model performance.

### ✅ 3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
- Supports **custom training on new datasets**.
- Evaluates using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

### ✅ 4️⃣ User Interface (Optional)
- Web app using **Flask/Streamlit** for easy image upload and detection.

### ✅ 5️⃣ Model Deployment Ready
- Can be deployed using **Flask API, FastAPI, or Streamlit**.
- Supports **TensorFlow Serving** for production.
